# scubadive-log
   

          
This is a project where users can create logs for daily dives. Its a web-application built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It was inspired by an app that I had build before using React. The app lives at https://AntonBrito.github.io/DiveLog.



## User Story
 - A user can create a new dive by:
              - Diver's name, 
                  - Location name, Depth 0 - 100 Ft
          - A user can delete  dive; 



### Feature for the Future
 - A user can add a budy-diver to a dive-log 
         - A user can add water temperature; 



## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
